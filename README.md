# Handwired 40% with OLED

![Oled_macro](https://github.com/Cipulot/Oled_macro/blob/main/docs/media/Oled_macro.jpg)

A compact 40% (12x4) ortholinear keyboard with OLED screen support.

## Project status

Hardware base is completed, but being handwired you can customize it further more and/or modify it.

Software is in constant change and being updated on my qmk_firmware fork available [here](https://github.com/Cipulot/qmk_firmware). You can find a basic default code example (with precompiled binaries) in this repo too if you want to quickly get it up and running.

## Repo structure

- `Docs` contains all documentation and images for the project.
- `Firmware` contains both the source and precompiled binaries for Hub16.
- `Hardware` contains the KiCad design files for the keyboard.
